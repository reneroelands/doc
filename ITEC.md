## NECTGEN programma

[NXTGEN SEMICON](https://nxtgenhightech.nl/semiconductors/)
is er meer info bij SIOUX?

Apparently the NXTGEN SEMICON has different technologies. The following were recognized:

- Semicon 02: cyber-physical systems architectures
- Semicon 03: Chip Assembly Equipment
- Semicon 05: Laser incuced deposition and chip release technology

The main goal of NXTGEN Chip Assembly Equipment (Semincon03) is:

- Developing new technological principles for assembling (micro)chips, based on handling via force fields rather than mechatronic handling.

## Letter of Intent

### Goal

- The goal of this Project is to develop the technologies and processes for the next generation high-volume, high efficiency and high-precision chip assembly equipment.

Rationale:

- This technology offers the potential to work much more accurately and quickly, at much lower energy consumption. The technology therefore has the potential to become a control point in the chip assembly equipment value chain: a technology that other players in the market cannot ignore.

### Cooperation

In the Project both ITEC and Sioux will work closely together to develop a proof-of-concept of the optomechatronic chip bonder, consisting of 3 modules (“Modules”), whereby:

- Sioux will concentrate on the equipment for:
  - the High Throughput Dispense and
  - the Substrate Control Module,
- whilst ITEC will focus on the develop of the
  - Chip Bonding Module.

We strive for synergy maximization of e.g. optical concepts. ITEC will provide (or be a liaison for) mandatory processes knowledge (like e.g. LIFT & LDT) required to use said technology and equipment. The detailed requirements of the technology and equipment will be co-created and used to manage and control scope of the project.

### Money

- SIOUX 2.8 MEuro (see [projectbegroting](https://siouxeu.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SiouxNLSubsidies/EUdd38X22FlEgdfNAbVcd3AB7Jo7wolf3cWPw8oSOOB-aA?e=qJhoUn)
- ITEC purchases 1.9 MEuro IP, in quarterly batches (158 kEuro?)

### Responsibility Sioux

Sioux will do its outmost best during the project to develop as much as possible technology and equipment for the initial foreseen relevant modules but can only fulfil this to the best of it’s abilities.

## Final proposal for NXTGEN

The proposal can be found [here](https://siouxeu.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SiouxNLSubsidies/EZKcqTNLHENGqWGTe_ipS1UBG7S9Jm9gsecvMUTS7Meyrw?e=7YI72J)

### Summary

Semicon03: NXTGEN Chip Assembly Equipment is one of the projects within the NXTGEN HIGHTECH collaborative project. The goal of the NXTGEN Chip Assembly Equipment project is to establish the supporting technologies and process flows for the next generation of high-volume, high-efficiency and high-precision chip assembly equipment. The Netherlands is originally a strong player in the semiconductor manufacturing and assembly market. Worldwide, the demand for these products is growing exponentially.  Current chip assembly technology increasingly falls short in terms of productivity, flexibility and energy consumption per assembled chip. Today's mechatronics solutions provide high production volumes and precision, but are (too) expensive and not efficient enough.    Further developments on the same architecture lines cannot properly address the new market needs. To continue to play a role in this rapidly developing industry, the Netherlands must continue to innovate.

In this project, the project partners, led by ITEC B.V., aim to pave the way for future chip assembly systems based on force field technology. The aim is to set up traditionally mechatronic process steps with non-contact handling based on precisely controlled force fields and thus to be able to assemble semiconductor products in an energy-efficient, low-cost and fully digitally controllable manner.   The paradigm shift that the project partners are trying to achieve with this is driven by both market trends and the urgency to create a sustainable industry.  Both existing and new applications in the semiconductor industry require a breakthrough in implementing heterogeneous integration processes. In order to continue to provide successful solutions in the future, technology sustainability is necessary.  One of the greatest opportunities for sustainability lies in reducing energy consumption in the assembly process of chip production.

This project ensures that the Netherlands can further strengthen its leading position in the global semiconductor industry by being the first to implement fully digital machine architectures in the electronics manufacturing value chain.  The project partners are taking the lead in realizing a sustainable chip production process and a transition to a green society.

### Driver

***Principle driver***:
The continuously increasing market demand for faster systems, higher throughput and lower production costs per assembled end product requires a technological breakthrough in chip assembly technology.

***Secondary driver***:
Moreover, many socially relevant innovations depend on semiconductor technology. To ensure that innovations in socially relevant domains such as energy systems, medical technology and eHealth are not hampered in their rollout, it is  therefore crucial that technology for chip assembly processes continue to develop in the coming years.

Q: *what are heterogenous integration procesess?*

A:

- Heterogeneous Integration refers to the integration of separately manufactured components into a higher level assembly ( System-in-Package, SiP) that, in the aggregate, provides enhanced functionality and improved operating characteristics. [ASE](https://ase.aseglobal.com/en/heterogeneous_integration)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/heterogeneous-integration-revolution-semiconductor-kai-beckmann/)

***Examples***:

- *miniLED Displays*: needs upscaling 20-40x to be cost efficient
- *Panel level manufacturing*, [panel level packaging](https://www.izm.fraunhofer.de/en/abteilungen/system_integrationinterconnectiontechnologies/arbeitsgebiete/panel-level-packaging.html)

***Buzzwords***

- Smart Manufacturing/Industry 4.0
- Cyber Physical Systems architecture
- digital twinning
- artificial intelligence

### Research question

- How do we define and realize the Cyber Physical Systems architectures that will make the breakthroughs for large-scale parallelization and ultra-high speeds in manufacturing processes? How do we apply them in the semiconductor manufacturing environment?
- What are the preconditions and requirements for robustly implementing heterogeneous
integration and advanced packaging involving force fields in the assembly process? E.g., new processes need to be developed for mechanical and electrical connecting individual chips.
- How do we define and implement cyber layers for complete autonomous system control and integration of Industry 4.0 principles suitable for future Smart Industry manufacturing environments? Examples include condition monitoring for critical tasks and the necessary components for predictive maintenance

***WP4***
| | |
|----|----|
|Purpose | The objective of work package 4 "Proof-of-Concept Optomechatronic Chip
Bonder" is to develop several proof-of-concept modules that will be integrated into the machine in WP6. |
| WP owner | Sioux Technologies |
|Subsiduaries | ITEC, TNO |
| Duration | M04– M30 |
| Research type | IO (Applied research (IO) is original research done to acquire new knowledge. However, it is primarily directed toward a specific, practical goal. Applied research is conducted to determine possible applications for the findings of basic research or to find new methods or ways to achieve specific and predetermined objectives.)|
| Activities |  Three main tasks are defined in this work package. These consist of modules that demonstrate the various main functions of the chip bonder. The modules are specified, designed, built and tested. To enable parallel development, several building blocks (submodules) are defined, each of which makes one or more modules technically possible. This will make use of the technology being developed in the  programs of Semicon 02 (cyber-physical systems system architectures) and Semicon 05 (laser-assisted deposition and chip release technology). |
| | T4.1 "High Throughput Dispense" is the development of a dispense station with very high throughput and flexibility based on LIFT technology. This allows the various adhesives required for bonding chips to be placed with high accuracy including quality inspections. The responsibility for this task lies with ITEC. This module requires several building blocks, the laser print head (BB4.1), a motion stage (BB4.2), inspections (BB4.3) and material handling (BB4.4) to correctly feed the adhesive.|
| | T4.2 "Chip Bonding Module" is the chip bonding module to place the chips of a wafer on the substrate with adhesive. Using "direct-die-attach", this module will place chips directly from the source wafer onto the target substrate with high accuracy including quality inspections. This with a throughput of more than 300,000 chips per hour. This module requires the building blocks laser print head (BB4.1), two motion stages (BB4.2) and inspections (BB4.3).|
| | T4.3 "Substrate Surface Control" involves the modules and sensorics to align the source and target substrate for transfer. The direct-die-attach principle requires very accurate positioning and air gap between two (large) substrates. This positioning will have to be actively controlled including local deformations. This requires the building blocks laser print head (BB4.1) and motion stage (BB4.2).|
| | Equipment needed for validation are industrial sensors for qualification of laser modules, vibration and positioning, optical microscopes and high-speed cameras. The development and integration activities will take place at Sioux Technologies (Eindhoven) in collaboration with ITEC (Nijmegen).
